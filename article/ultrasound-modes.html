        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p><strong>M-mode</strong> takes a single, vertical segment and creates a 2D tracing of movement over time. The y-axis aligns with points along the vertical segment, and the x-axis measures time. Thus, the graph plots changes in depths of echo-producing interfaces per unit of time, representing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Color-flow Doppler</strong> mode shows directional flow qualitatively. With the color map shown, red represents flow towards the transducer, and blue is flow away from the transducer.</p>
<p><strong>Power-flow Doppler</strong> shows flow but does not indicate direction. It is very sensitive and can be used for identifying perfusion in tissue that has a low perfusion state, such as the testicles. Alternatively, it can be used to detect tissue movement, such as in this clip of lung sliding.</p>
<p><strong>Pulsed-wave Doppler</strong> shows two images simultaneously on the monitor. At the top is a sampling gate, and at the bottom are flow waveforms with velocity represented as the height of the waveform.</p>
