<p>Treat this pt with:<br />
Amiodarone<br />
Magnesium<br />
Defibrillation<br />
Cardioversion, or<br />
Pacemaker</p>
<p>Rhythm strip looks like torsades, but it has those little spikes, it's not smoothly polymorphic VT. This torsades-like appearance in an awake pt is artifact. It is impossible to have some leads be polyVT and others not. It's all or nothing.<br />
We can see lead III shows us normal complexes that are very regular, and is in fact complete heart block.<br />
Complexes in lead III align with weird spikes in other leads.</p>
<p>Repeat EKG<br />

<p>Pt had parkinson's and resting tremor was causing the artifact.</p>

This is also artifact, The spikes march out regularly.<br />
For this case, ortho, ED doc, and cards fellow thought it was torsades and started amiodarone. Cards attending said no it's artifact.</p>
