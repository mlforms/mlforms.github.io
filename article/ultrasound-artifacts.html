        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p><strong>Acoustic enhancement:</strong> Refers to hyperechogenicity deep to structures that transmit sound exceptionally well.<br />
<img src="/_resources/34c0ab4a9819417892fd90deafe90a5d.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Acoustic shadowing:</strong> is characterized by a signal void behind structures that strongly absorb/reflect ultrasonic waves.<br />
<img src="/_resources/708cf56f81904b9c8293910e4eab7202.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bowel gas scatter</strong><br />
<img src="/_resources/cd95302cfe104adb9c4fb85cc67b3eae.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Refraction:</strong> Occurs when sound travels across one medium into another and changes speed. The sound waves are refracted at the boundary.</p>
<p><img src="/_resources/f47fc0406e424000a916097ad6131f4d.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edge Artifact:</strong> Often noted distal to smooth, rounded cavities containing fluid with a speed of sound transmission that markedly differs relative to surrounding tissue. This creates a refractile edge-shadowing artifact, characterized by narrow, hypoechoic, shadow lines extending distal to the lateral edges of the fluid cavity</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Comet-tail:</strong> When reverberations occur between two closely spaced reflectors. A comet-tail artifact is a type of reverb artifact characterized by a series of closely spaced, discrete echoes.<br />

<hr />
<p><strong>Ring-down Artifact:</strong> Associated with gas bubbles. Resonance results in the bubbles becoming stimulated into vibration by the energy of the ultrasound wave. These vibrations result in near-continuous sound wave transmission which creates the echogenic line or lines extending parallel and distal to the bubbles.</p>
<p><img src="/_resources/32bfa42693294dc7ba075e012c7a0a6e.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Speckle:</strong> Results from interference effects of scattered sound within tissues. This grainy appearance results from the constructive and destructive interference of echoes returning simultaneously.<br />
<img src="/_resources/1ccc8381a4364c3aad3d720a74118a3e.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mirror-image:</strong> The primary ultrasound beam encounters the pleural-air interface and is reflected back towards the liver and back towards the pleural-air interface. The resultant ultrasound image displays a duplicate structure equidistant from, but on the opposite side of, the reflective surface.<br />
This can be used to rule out any fluid in the chest, as it appears only when the chest has no fluid. This makes the absence of a mirror-image artifact very helpful in diagnosing hemothorax or pleural effusion.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Beam-width Artifact:</strong> Arises from the progressive widening of an ultrasound beam distal to its focal zone. Eventually, the beam width may exceed the footprint of the transducer. A highly reflective structure that is encountered by this widened sound beam may erroneously be displayed within the narrow central imaging plane</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Side lobe Artifact:</strong> where side lobes reflect sound from a strong reflector that is outside of the central beam, and where the echoes are displayed as if they originated from within the central beam.<br />
<img src="/_resources/27767052d83047c8803c40d40acc080c.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Speed Displacement Artifact:</strong> When the ultrasound beam encounters tissue with a slower propagation speed (e.g., fat),  the returning signal will take longer which results in echoes appearing deeper in the image than they actually are.<br />
