        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>Pigtail kit has:</p>
<ul>
<li>small 11 blade</li>
<li>needles/dilator/pigtail/obturator</li>
<li>guidewire</li>
<li>sutures</li>
<li>5mL 1% lido</li>
<li>empty syringe for needle</li>
<li>gauze 4x4s</li>
<li>a chlorhex prep stick<br />
<br class="jop-noMdConv" /><br />
<br class="jop-noMdConv" /></li>
</ul>
<p>I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>gown</li>
<li>sterile gloves</li>
<li>bouffant</li>
<li>chest tube set-up</li>
<li>occlusive dressing<br />
<br class="jop-noMdConv" /> <br class="jop-noMdConv" /></li>
</ul>
<p>On field:</p>
<ul>
<li>50mL syringe</li>
<li>2% lidocaine</li>
<li>a couple 10cc syringes</li>
<li>a couple 18 and 23-25g needles</li>
</ul>
<p>Difficulties:</p>
<ul>
<li>the suction mark from my 3cc syringe did not last and by the time I was ready to poke the chest wall it was gone</li>
<li>didn't put obturator in pigtail ahead of time</li>
<li>I should've attached 3-way stopcock to the tubing and 1-way valve ahead of time</li>
<li>awkward coordination pulling introducer needle off the wire b/c with my hand at the base the needle will poke me if it slides down the wire. also the plastic tip part that helps feed the wire was stuck in the distal end of the needle which was annoying and made it hard to grasp the needle with the hand on the end of the wire</li>
<li>didn't know how far to put the styletted pigtail into the chest, could've put it 3-4cm too far and punctured the lung. I should measure depth with ultrasound or compare with introducer needle to estimate depth needed</li>
<li>should go right over a rib like with normal chest tube, not right between the ribs</li>
<li>make a conscious effort to direct the pigtail upward</li>
<li>when making the nick, cut paralle to the rib</li>
<li>don't saw with the 11 blade, just insert and slide</li>
<li>first nick was a little too small for the dilator</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>I only needed to dilate like 1-2cm and pigtail pasted fine</li>
<li>for very skinny pt I used about 8cc 2% lido</li>
<li>50 fentanyl and 2mg versed worked well</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>open kit on tray, set gown and gloves aside to put on shortly</li>
<li>fill 4x4 well with betadine sterily</li>
<li>dump OR clothes, 10cc syringes, needles, 50cc syringe</li>
</ul>
