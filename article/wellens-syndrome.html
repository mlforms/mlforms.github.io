<p>Wellens syndrome represents a high-grade stenosis of the proximal LAD. Its natural progression often leads to anterior wall MI. Patients classically present with chest pain or pressure that resolves on its own before or during initial evaluation or after the patient receives nitroglycerin or pain medications. The initial ECG (while having pain) may not demonstrate the classic finding, however, it becomes evident when the patient becomes pain-free. Classically, Wellens’ sign is described as biphasic T-wave inversion or deep symmetrical T waves in leads V2-V4. ECG will be without Q waves and significant ST segment elevation, and with normal precordial R-wave progression. Cardiac enzymes are normal or minimally elevated. Medical management alone is not enough to stop natural progression, and thus additional management is required. Understanding and recognizing Wellens’ syndrome is of great importance as ST elevation may not be present and cardiac enzymes may also be negative. If the patient is subjected to a stress test for further cardiac evaluation, she may have sudden decompensation due to complete LAD occlusion and demonstrate an anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction. Treatment of patients with Wellens’ syndrome includes aspirin therapy, heparinization and urgent cardiac catheterization to evaluate the need for angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.</p>
<p>Unstable angina is on the continuum of acute coronary syndromes and resides between stable angina and ST elevation myocardial infarction. Patients are said to have unstable angina if they begin to experience angina at rest that lasts more than 20 minutes in duration, new-onset angina that limits physical activity, or increasing angina that is more frequent, longer in duration, or occurs with less exertion than previous angina. The difference between unstable angina and acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause myocardial damage that results in detectable quantities of cardiac troponins.</p>

Wellen's Mimics</h1>
<p>There is a variant of BER that looks like Wellens. This variant is really only diagnosable in males of AA or Caribbean descent and when the EKG has overall high voltage.<br />
<em>Cannot diagnose in women or white/asian males.</em><br />

<p>The little fishhooks leading into the T wave are suggestive of BER variant. Also, has quite high voltage compared to amplitude of T wave.<br />
"Fish hook, then concave upwards, then very sharp drop down"<br />
Overall: Fishhook, the concave upward, then steep drop is pattern of BER not Wellen's, though cath lab is still reasonable to r/o STEMI.</p>
<p>Another example of BER:<br />
